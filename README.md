### Abstract 
The reflection of light rays depends on various factors such as source, intensity, direction. The environment or material in which it is being reflected also greatly influences its reflection, which makes it a complicated phenomenon to appreciate through physical measurements. However, the behavior of a light ray does not end in a single reflection, the complete phenomenon can lead to several reflections at different points of incidence and with a considerable loss of intensity. This phenomenon can be simulated using OpenGL with C++.
